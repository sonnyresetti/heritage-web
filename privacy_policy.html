    Mr.Takahashi is a software application released by Openup Technologies on various platforms to help users out in
    their
    daily life through an StitchFam. We limit the data we collect to what is necessary to use the app and make sales.
    Below,
    we outline what data we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights.

    Data Collection and Use

    Account Data

    When you sign up for an account with Mr.Takahashi, you are asked to connect your google account. We ask this to get
    your
    name so Mr.Takahashi can use it when he speaks to you .

    Device and App Activity Data

    When you use the app, we automatically collect certain information about your device (such as the type of device,
    operating system, IP address, and unique identifiers) and how you interact with the app (such as the actions you
    take
    and how long you use the app). We use this information to improve the app, create new features, and keep our systems
    secure.

    How We Disclose Data

    We do not sell, rent, license, or lease your data to third parties, nor do we share it with third parties for
    cross-context behavioral advertising. However, we may disclose it to the following third parties:

    Service Providers – such as hosting services, customer support services, and analytics services.

    Professional Advisors – such as lawyers and accountants.

    Business Transaction Recipients – including counterparties and others assisting with a merger, acquisition,
    financing,
    reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, dissolution, asset sale, or similar transaction involving our business.

    Legal and Safety – government authorities or regulators or other third parties where required by law or legal
    process or
    to protect Mecha Shop users’, or other third parties’ rights and safety.





    Data Security

    Security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality of your data.

    Data Retention

    We keep your data until we don’t need it for the purposes described in this policy and we have no legal obligation
    to
    keep it.

    Your Rights

    We provide all users with the following rights:

    Deactivation of account

    Access information of the data we collected, where it is required by law;

    Delete – you can request that we delete the data we have about you, but this right is not absolute. We may need to
    keep
    certain information, for example, to comply with our legal requirements;

    Correct – you can ask that we fix any errors or inaccuracies in the data we hold about you;

    Stop processing – you can tell us to stop processing your data;

    Object – you can object to how we process your data;

    Complain – you can complain to the data protection regulator where you live (if you have one).

    You can exercise these rights by contacting us on our website, texting us at (682) 552-9882, or emailing us at
    support@stitchfam.com and providing the username and phone number associated with your account in your message. We
    will
    not treat you differently if you exercise any of these rights, but we may need additional information to verify your
    identity. An agent can also make these requests on your behalf, but we may still ask you to verify your identity and
    that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf. Depending on your location, you may have the right to
    appeal
    our decision regarding a request related to the above rights, in which case, you may do so by contacting us using

    preference”
    signal, or other mechanism for exercising your choice regarding the collection of your data when you visit various
    websites and online services. Our website and app are not designed to respond to such signals, and we do not use or
    disclose your data in any way that would legally require us to recognize opt-out preference signals.

    We may need to update this policy to account for changes in our business and applicable laws. If we change this
    policy,
    we will post the new version here. If the changes are significant we will notify you through the app.
